<h1>Optical Character Recognition</h1>
</div>

Optical character recognition (OCR) is sometimes referred to as text recognition. An OCR program extracts and repurposes data from scanned documents, camera images and image-only pdfs. OCR software singles out letters on the image, puts them into words and then puts the words into sentences, thus enabling access to and editing of the original content. It also eliminates the need for manual data entry.

OCR systems use a combination of hardware and software to convert physical, printed documents into machine-readable text. Hardware — such as an optical scanner or specialized circuit board — copies or reads text; then, software typically handles the advanced processing.

<h3>How does optical character recognition work?</h3>
Optical character recognition (OCR) uses a scanner to process the physical form of a document. Once all pages are copied, OCR software converts the document into a two-color or black-and-white version. The scanned-in image or bitmap is analyzed for light and dark areas, and the dark areas are identified as characters that need to be recognized, while light areas are identified as background. The dark areas are then processed to find alphabetic letters or numeric digits. This stage typically involves targeting one character, word or block of text at a time. Characters are then identified using one of two algorithms — ```pattern recognition or feature recognition```.

```Pattern recognition``` is used when the OCR program is fed examples of text in various fonts and formats to compare and recognize characters in the scanned document or image file.

```Feature detection``` occurs when the OCR applies rules regarding the features of a specific letter or number to recognize characters in the scanned document. Features include the number of angled lines, crossed lines or curves in a character. For example, the capital letter “A” is stored as two diagonal lines that meet with a horizontal line across the middle. When a character is identified, it is converted into an ```ASCII code``` (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) that computer systems use to handle further manipulations.

An OCR program also analyzes the structure of a document image. It divides the page into elements such as blocks of texts, tables or images. The lines are divided into words and then into characters. Once the characters have been singled out, the program compares them with a set of pattern images. After processing all likely matches, the program presents you with the recognized text.
